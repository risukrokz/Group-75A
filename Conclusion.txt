--- Conclusions ---
 

1.  Results explained (75 words) 
 
The results explain the difference in the average tumor size between the two groups. Malignant(harmful) tumors had a much larger radius_mean value of 17.46283 than Benign(non-harmful) tumors 12.15885. 
  

Statistical test confirmed that the difference is real and not due to chance.  
 

P-value was extremely small, showing the data strongly supports the idea that malignant tumors tend to be bigger.  
 

In this tumor size is closely linked to where a tumor is cancerous or not.

2.  Interpretation of the results (75 words) 

 
These results answer the research question by showing that tumor radius_mean can help tell the difference between Malignant and Benign breast tumors. In simple terms, larger tumors were much more likely to be Malignant.  

 

This could help doctors make quicker decisions or identify patients who need further checks.  

While size alone can’t replace full medical tests, it can act as an early warning sign and can help provide valuable medical clues.

3. Reasons and/or implications for future work, limitations of your study (50 words) 
 
To further increase the credibility of this research question, additional statistical tests should be done.  
 
It is recommended to expand the research to include multivariate analysis to find the relationship between the tumor features. 
 
The sample came from one source, which may limit general accuracy.
