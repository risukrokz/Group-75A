Correlation

Project Title: Relationship Between Mean Radius and Mean Perimeter in Breast Tumors
Research Question: Is there a correlation between radius_mean and perimeter_mean in breast tumors?
  
Dependent Variable: radius_mean (Interval)
Independent Variable: perimeter_mean (Interval)

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no correlation between radius_mean and perimeter_mean in breast tumors.
Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a correlation between radius_mean and perimeter_mean in breast tumors.

Comparison of Proportions

Project Title: Difference in Proportion of Tumors with Concave Points Between Malignant and Benign Breast Tumors
Research Question: Is the proportion of tumors with concave points_mean > 0 different between malignant and benign breast tumors?
  
Dependent Variable: concave points_mean → HasConcavePoints (Nominal)
Independent Variable: diagnosis (Nominal)

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the proportion of tumors with concave points_mean > 0 between malignant and benign breast tumors.
Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the proportion of tumors with concave points_mean > 0 between malignant and benign breast tumors.
